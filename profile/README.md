## üöÄ Overview

CM Batch Photo Processor is a comprehensive macOS application created for photographers, designers, content creators, and anyone handling large numbers of images who needs to automate repetitive tasks. Rather than resizing, renaming, or converting photos one by one, this app lets you apply those operations in bulk, freeing you to focus on creativity rather than tedious workflow.

From standard image resizing (downsizing or upsizing) to formatting output, watermarking, and applying visual effects, CM Batch Photo Processor consolidates many distinct tools into one clean and efficient interface. Whether you have RAW files from your high-end camera, HEIC images from your phone, or any assorted formats from different sources, you can bring all that material into a consistent output‚Äîoptimized for web, print, archive, or sharing.
